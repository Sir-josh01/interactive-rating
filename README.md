## Overview

This is an interactive rating component that allows a user to rate the quality of service of a company or enterprise. it involves the use of HTML and CSS to build it structure and beautify it. It also involves the use of javascript to allow user choose a rating of service from number 1 to 5, giving off a thank you page and message for their feedback.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

-i started with the HTML structure and continue with the CSS file. i later added the javascript functionality. Making the thank you final design to pop up after clicking the submit button was a challenge. i had to delete and re-coded some fucntions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- i better understood DOM manipulation and the use of forEach().
- Manipulation of CSS styles using javascript.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')

    if (value === null) {
    alert('Please select a value');

  } else {
    output.innerHTML = `You selected ${value} out of 5`
  }


```
### Continued development
- I would like to know of javaScript manipulation and functionality

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.chrome.com) - This helped me for fonts-acqusition. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.chatGPT.com) - This is an amazing tool which helped me finally understand DOM manipulaton and much more. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
